# Favorite Vacation Spot
### Panama City Beach:

My grandpa and grandma own a condo down in PCB, which is my favoerite vacation spot. I've been down there since I was 4 years old. In the future I would love to own a condo on the beach. My favorite memory is going on jet ski with my parents to shells island. We got to see dolphins, and pigs while riding to the island.
