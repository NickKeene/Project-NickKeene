# My Sports History 
### My Brief Summary:
During my freshman year of highschool, I only played basketball because I was around 6'6. I was a pretty good player and made the Freshman and Jv team at my highschool. During my second year, I tore my ACL and had to miss the whole basketball season. This caused me to loose a lot of my skills and stamina so it became hard to get back on track. During this time my family made a move to Collinsville to be closer to family. I had to adjust to getting used to the school and work back into basketball. My family ended up moving back to Missouri, and I got to return to my highschool. I made varsity my junior year and had a good year. I started to get college interest in the summer during AAU. My senior was very memorable for me because I had a great year. My team made it to the elite eight, and I was one the all conference team for my school. The overall record was **26-3** . Overall, I had option to play basketball at the next level, but decided to focus on school instead. Basketball gave me a lot of great life lessons that I will remember forever.
